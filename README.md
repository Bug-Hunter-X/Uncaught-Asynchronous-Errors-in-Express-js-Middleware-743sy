# Uncaught Asynchronous Errors in Express.js Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js asynchronous programming, specifically within Express.js middleware.  Errors thrown inside asynchronous callbacks might not be caught by Express's error-handling middleware if not properly handled within the callback itself.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js application that simulates an asynchronous operation that might fail. If the operation fails, an error is thrown. However, because this happens *inside* the asynchronous callback (the `setTimeout` function), the error isn't caught by the standard error handling middleware.  This results in the application potentially crashing silently or displaying unexpected behavior.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach. The error is explicitly caught within the asynchronous callback using a `try...catch` block.  This ensures that the error is handled gracefully, and the Express.js error middleware functions as expected.
